# wafflr

Wafflr is a student-first dining app that actively encourages students to engage in healthy eating habits. While the app brings students the standard information of any other campus dining app, including meals, dining hall hours, etc., the app is optimized to help students (i) find nutritious meals they never knew about, (ii) figure out where to go for lunch, and (iii) engage in campus-wide discussion about campus food.

When the student opens the app, they are greeted with a map, the suggested dining hall, the top three recommended foods, the dining hall capacity, and the dining hall’s distance from their current location (above). Although the map is just a placeholder image at this point in development, it would show the suggested dining hall and the user’s friends eating there in the last 30 minutes. When the small map is pressed, the app switches to the full map tab which can be used to view all of the campus’s dining halls (below).

Knowing which friends are eating where, the user can make a better-informed, spontaneous decision on where to eat. Note that users’ locations are only shown to their friends, and location is only shown when the user is at a dining hall. The suggested foods include a review and average rating to encourage active discussion of the foods, albeit in a light-hearted and hopefully humorous way. If the user does not want to go to the suggested dining hall, they only need to swipe horizontally on the map for it to shift to another dining hall.

Alternatively, the user can go to the dining tab to pick a dining hall (above). They can filter to see which places are open, nearby, and not busy. When a dining hall is pressed, then the menu tab opens (below).

Alternatively, the user can go to the dining tab to pick a dining hall (Figure 3). They can filter to see which places are open, nearby, and not busy. When a dining hall is pressed, then the menu tab opens (Figure 4). While I did not have the time to finish placing example meals on this page, note that the recommended meals show by default before the full menu. In doing so, I hope to encourage the student to find a meal they did not know existed yet but, based on their previous ratings of other foods, would be likely to also enjoy. 


There are a few key aspects of the menu screen that are integral to the app but have not yet been added due to time constraints—despite ~25 hours of coding! For each meal, there will be the name, its average rating, a button to view more, and a flag. The flag would be used for reporting any incidents ranging from someone experiencing an allergic reaction after that food or even to smaller incidents like cross-contamination. This feature would allow such incidents to be centralized, which then could help me create some kind of risk profile statistic for each food.

There is one last element of the app: ratings. While the user is at a dining hall, a widget would display on the lock screen to ask for the food eaten and its rating. Uber and Lyft have started using this system to convey pickup time data as well as encourage users to rate their drivers after the ride (Figure 5), yet few other apps have yet to leverage this new IOS feature. Rating data is paramount to the app’s viability because it allows students to give unbiased feedback on the food quality, which can then be leveraged to gauge the quality of life for students with food allergies and restrictions. 


Ultimately, I’m confident that Wafflr’s rating and reports systems could help keep the schools accountable and make constant progress, rather than allowing problems to build up until a lawsuit occurs. The latter causes pain and suffering both for the students with food allergies and the schools, so I think smaller yet more consistent strides toward compliance with the ADA would benefit all parties. Moreover, I believe Wafflr can inadvertently encourage college students to eat more safely by bringing them access to nutritious, allergen-safe meals.
